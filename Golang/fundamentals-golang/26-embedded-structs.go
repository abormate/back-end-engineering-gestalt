// -------------------------------- //

/*
Go is not an object-oriented language. However, embedded structs provide a kind of data-only inheritance that can be useful at 
times. Keep in mind, Go doesn't support classes or inheritance in the complete sense, embedded structs are just a way to elevate 
and share fields between struct definitions.
