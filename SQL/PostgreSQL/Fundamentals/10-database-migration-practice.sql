/*
When writing migrations that are reversible, we use the terms "up" and "down" migrations. An "up" migration is simply the 
set of changes you want to make, like altering/removing/adding/editing a table in some way. A "down" migration includes 
the changes that would revert any of the "up" migration's changes.
