-- Which Databases
--
---------------------------------------- //

/*
When working with SQL it is common to use specific database technologies such as:

SQLite
PostgreSQL
MySQL
Oracle

*/

/*
Although many different databases use the SQL language, but most of them will have their own dialect. It's very important 
to understand that not all databases are created equal. Just because one relational database does things a certain way, 
doesn't mean every relational database will follow those same patterns.

-- What we're using -- SQLite
--------------------------- //

/*
In this course we'll be using SQLite specifically. SQLite is great for embedded projects, web browsers, and toy projects. 
It's very lightweight, but has limited functionality compared to the likes of PostgresQL or MySQL - two of the more 
common production SQL technologies.

We'll point out to you whenever some functionality we're working with is unique to SQLite!
