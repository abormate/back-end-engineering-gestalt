Whenever you update your profile picture or change your password online, you are changing the data in a field 
on a table in a database! Imagine if every time you accidentally messed up a Tweet on Twitter you had to 
delete the entire tweet and post a new one instead of just editing it...

...Well, that's a bad example.
