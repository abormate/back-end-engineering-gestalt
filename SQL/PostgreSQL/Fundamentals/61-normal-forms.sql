/*
The creator of "database normalization", Edgar F. Codd described different "normal forms" a database can adhere to. We'll talk about the most common ones.

First normal form (1NF)
Second normal form (2NF)
Third normal form (3NF)
Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)


*/

/*
In short, 1st normal form is the least "normalized" form, and Boyce-Codd is the most "normalized" form.

The more normalized a database, the better its data integrity, and the less duplicate data you'll have.
