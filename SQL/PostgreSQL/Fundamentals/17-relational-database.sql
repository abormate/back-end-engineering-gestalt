/*
We have been using the term relational quite a bit, it's time we actually go over what that means! A relational database is a 
type of database that stores data so that it can be easily related to other data. For example, a user can have many tweets. 
There's a relationship between a user and their tweet.

/*
In a relational database:

1. Data is typically represented in "tables".
2. Each table has "columns" or "fields that hold attributes related to the record.
3. Each row or entry in the table is called a record.
4. Typically, each record has a unique Id called the primary key.

Here is an example of a small relational database. This database has 3 tables, Students, Courses, and StudentCourses.
