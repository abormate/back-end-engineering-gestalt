/*
We've used the word schema a few times now, let's talk about what that word means. A database's schema describes how data is 
organized within it.

Data types, table names, field names, constraints, and the relationships between all of those entities are part of a database's 
schema.

-- Architecting a Database Schema
--------------------------- //

/*
When designing a database schema there typically isn't a "correct" solution. We do our best to choose a sane set of tables, 
fields, constraints, etc that will accomplish our project's goals. Like many things in programming, different schema designs 
come with different tradeoffs.
