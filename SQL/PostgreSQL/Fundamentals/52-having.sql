/*
When we need to filter the results of a GROUP BY query even further, we can use the HAVING clause. The HAVING clause specifies a search condition for a group.

The HAVING clause is similar to the WHERE clause, but it operates on groups after they've been grouped, rather than rows before they've been grouped.
