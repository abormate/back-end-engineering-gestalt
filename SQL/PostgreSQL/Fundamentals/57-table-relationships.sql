/*
Relational databases are powerful because of the relationships between the tables. These relationships help us to keep our databases clean and efficient. 
A relationship between tables assumes that one of these tables has a foreign key that references the primary key of another table.

-- One to One Relationship
---------------------------- //

/*
A one-to-one relationship most often manifests as a field or set of fields on a row in a table. For example, a user will have exactly one password.

Settings fields might be another example of a one-to-one relationship. A user will have exactly one email_preference and exactly one birthday.
