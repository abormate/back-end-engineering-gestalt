When working on a back-end application, this doesn't come up often, but it's important to remember that SQL is a full programming language. 
We usually use it to interact with data stored in tables, but it's quite flexible and powerful.

For example, you can SELECT information that's simply calculated, with no tables necessary.

SELECT 5 + 10 as sum;
