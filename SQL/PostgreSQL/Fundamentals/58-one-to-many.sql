-- One to Many -- SQL Table Relationship
--
---------------------------------------- //

/*
When talking about the relationships between tables, a one-to-many relationship is probably the most commonly used relationship.

A one-to-many relationship occurs when a single record in one table is related to potentially many records in another table.

Note that the one->many relation only goes one way, a record in the second table can not be related to multiple records in the first table!
