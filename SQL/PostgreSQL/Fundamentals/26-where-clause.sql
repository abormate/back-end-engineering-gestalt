/*
In order to keep learning about CRUD operations in SQL, we need to learn how to make the instructions we 
send to the database more specific. SQL accepts a WHERE statement within a query that allows us to be very 
specific with our instructions.

If we were unable to specify the specific record we wanted to READ, UPDATE, or DELETE making queries to a 
database would be very frustrating, and very inefficient.
