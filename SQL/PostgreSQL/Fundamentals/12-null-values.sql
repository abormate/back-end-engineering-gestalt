-- SQL Null Values
--
---------------------------------------- //

/*
In SQL a row with a NULL value represents that the value is missing. A NULL value within a row is very different than a 
zero value. When inserting records into a table, unless a constraint has been set, a record can be added with missing (NULL) 
fields.
