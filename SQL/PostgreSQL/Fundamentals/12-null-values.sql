-- SQL Null Values
--
---------------------------------------- //

/*
In SQL a row with a NULL value represents that the value is missing. A NULL value within a row is very different than a 
zero value. When inserting records into a table, unless a constraint has been set, a record can be added with missing (NULL) 
fields.

*/

-- Constraints
---------------------------- //

/*
When creating a table we can define whether or not a field can or cannot be NULL, and that's a kind of constraint.

We will cover constraints in more detail soon, for now, let's focus on NULL values.
