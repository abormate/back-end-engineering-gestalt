/*
Sometimes a single query is not enough to retrieve the specific records we need.

It is possible to run a query on the result set of another query - a query within a query! This is called "query-ception"... erm... I mean a "subquery".

Subqueries can be very useful in a number of situations when trying to retrieve specific data that wouldn't be accessible by simply querying a single table.
