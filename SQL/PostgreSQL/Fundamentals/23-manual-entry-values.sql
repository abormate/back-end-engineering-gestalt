/*
Manually INSERTing every single record in a database would be an extremely time-consuming task! Working with 
raw SQL as we are now is not super common when designing backend systems.

When working with SQL within a software system, like a backend web application, you'll typically have access 
to a programming language such as Go or Python. For example, a backend server written in Go can use string 
concatenation to dynamically create SQL statements, and that's usually how it's done!
