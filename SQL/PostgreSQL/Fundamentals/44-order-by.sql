/*
SQL also offers us the ability to sort the results of a query using ORDER BY. By default, the ORDER BY keyword sorts records by the given field in 
ascending order, or ASC for short. However, ORDER BY does support descending order as well with the keyword DESC.

*/

--------------------------- //
-- Examples
--------------------------- //

/*
This query returns the name, price, and quantity fields from the products table sorted by price in ascending order:

*/

SELECT name, price, quantity FROM products
    ORDER BY price;

/*
This query returns the name, price, and quantity of the products ordered by the quantity in descending order:

*/

SELECT name, price, quantity FROM products
    ORDER BY quantity desc;
