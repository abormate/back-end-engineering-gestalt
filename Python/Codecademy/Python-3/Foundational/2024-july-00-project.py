"""

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation 
and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your 
name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

"""

# -------------- #
# -- Task 00 --
# -------------- #

"""
Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each 
block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

"""

print(" SSS   L")
print("S   S  L")
print("S      L")
print(" SSS   L")
print("    S  L")
print("S   S  L")
print(" SSS   LLLLL")

# First, write two comments with:

# Abraham Bormate
# Works as an engineer who loves food and with being a big kid. :D 

# ------------- #
# -- Task 02 --
# ------------- #

"""
Output your first initial as a block letter. 
There are a few ways to do this!

"""

print(" SSS   L")
print("S   S  L")
print("S      L")
print(" SSS   L")
print("    S  L")
print("S   S  L")
print(" SSS   LLLLL")

print("    A     ")
print("   A A    ")
print("  A   A   ")
print(" AAAAAAA  ")
print("A       A ")

"""
Output your second initial as a block letter by adding to the print() 
statements.

"""

print("BBB")
print("B  B")
print("B  B")
print("BBB")
print("B  B")
print("B   B")
print("B   B")
print(" BBB")
