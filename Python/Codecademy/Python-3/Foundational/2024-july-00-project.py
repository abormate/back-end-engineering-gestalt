"""

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation 
and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your 
name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

"""
Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each 
block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

"""

print(" SSS   L")
print("S   S  L")
print("S      L")
print(" SSS   L")
print("    S  L")
print("S   S  L")
print(" SSS   LLLLL")
