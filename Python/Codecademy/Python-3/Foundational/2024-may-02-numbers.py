Computers can understand much more than just strings of text. Python 
has a few numeric data types. It has multiple ways of storing numbers. 
Which one you use depends on your intended purpose for the number you 
are saving.

An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and 
contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, â€¦) as well as their negative 
counterparts and the number 0. If you were counting the number of people 
in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the number of keys on a 
keyboard you would likely use an integer.

A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used 
to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. If 
you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall, calculating the 
average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball 
players batting average for the 1998 season you would likely use a 
float.
