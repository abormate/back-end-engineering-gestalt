Humans are prone to making mistakes. Humans are also typically in 
charge of creating computer programs. To compensate, programming 
languages attempt to understand and explain mistakes made in their 
programs.

Python refers to these mistakes as errors and will point to the 
location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs 
throw errors that we didnt expect to encounter we call those errors 
bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that 
it no longer produces unexpected errors debugging.

Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError 
and NameError.

SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is 
written — punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not 
expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not 
recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but 
was never defined will throw a NameError.
