"""
Humans are prone to making mistakes. Humans are also typically in 
charge of creating computer programs. To compensate, programming 
languages attempt to understand and explain mistakes made in their 
programs.

Python refers to these mistakes as errors and will point to the 
location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs 
throw errors that we didnâ€™t expect to encounter we call those errors 
bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that 
it no longer produces unexpected errors debugging.
