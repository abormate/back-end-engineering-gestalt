"""
Python offers a shorthand for updating variables. When you have a 
number saved in a variable and want to add to the current value of 
the variable, you can use the += (plus-equals) operator.

"""

# First we have a variable with a number saved
number_of_miles_hiked = 12

# Then we need to update that variable
# Let's say we hike another two miles today
number_of_miles_hiked += 2

# The new value is the old value
# Plus the number after the plus-equals
print(number_of_miles_hiked)
# Prints 14
