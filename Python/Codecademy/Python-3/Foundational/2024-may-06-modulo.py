"""
Python offers a companion to the division operator called the modulo operator. 
The modulo operator is indicated by % and gives the remainder of a division 
calculation. If the two numbers are divisible, then the result of the modulo 
operation will be 0.

"""

# Prints 4 because 29 / 5 is 5 with a remainder of 4
print(29 % 5)
 
# Prints 2 because 32 / 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2
print(32 % 3)
 
# Modulo by 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers
# Prints 0
print(44 % 2)


"""
Here, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations. 
We see that 29 % 5 equals 4, 32 % 3 equals 2, and 44 % 2 equals 0.

Lets look at another example to get a better idea of how modulo is useful in 
programming:

"""

print(3 % 3) # Prints 0
print(4 % 3) # Prints 1
print(5 % 3) # Prints 2
print(6 % 3) # Prints 0
print(7 % 3) # Prints 1
