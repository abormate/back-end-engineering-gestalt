"""
Python strings are very flexible, but if we try to create a string 
that occupies multiple lines we find ourselves face-to-face with a 
SyntaxError. 

Python offers a solution: multi-line strings. By using 
three quote-marks instead of one, we tell the program that the 
string doesnâ€™t end until the next triple-quote. This method is 
useful if the string being defined contains a lot of quotation 
marks and we want to be sure we dont close it prematurely.
