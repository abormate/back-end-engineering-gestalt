"""
Python strings are very flexible, but if we try to create a string 
that occupies multiple lines we find ourselves face-to-face with a 
SyntaxError. 

Python offers a solution: multi-line strings. By using 
three quote-marks instead of one, we tell the program that the 
string doesnt end until the next triple-quote. This method is 
useful if the string being defined contains a lot of quotation 
marks and we want to be sure we dont close it prematurely.

Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!
Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,
But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than
  before known,
Arouse! for you must justify me.
