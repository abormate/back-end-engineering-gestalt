"""

Weve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and 
open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites 
on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, 
were going to build a system to help speed up the process of 
creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a 
furniture stores catalog in variables. You will then process 
the total price and item list of customers, printing them to 
the output terminal.

# -- Task 00 --

"""
Lets add in our first item, the Lovely Loveseat that is the 
stores namesake. Create a variable called 
lovely_loveseat_description and assign to it the following 
string:

"""

lovely_loveseat_description = "Lovely Loveseat. Tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white."

Great, now lets create a price for the loveseat. Create a variable lovely_loveseat_price and set it equal to 254.00.

"""

lovely_loveseat_price = 254.00

"""
Our first customer is making their purchase! Lets keep a 
running tally of their expenses by defining a variable called
