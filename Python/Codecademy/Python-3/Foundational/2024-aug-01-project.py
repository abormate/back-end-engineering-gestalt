"""

Weve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and 
open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites 
on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, 
were going to build a system to help speed up the process of 
creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a 
furniture stores catalog in variables. You will then process 
the total price and item list of customers, printing them to 
the output terminal.

"""
Lets add in our first item, the Lovely Loveseat that is the 
stores namesake. Create a variable called 
lovely_loveseat_description and assign to it the following 
string:

"""

lovely_loveseat_description = "Lovely Loveseat. Tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white."

"""
Great, now lets create a price for the loveseat. Create a variable lovely_loveseat_price and set it equal to 254.00.

"""

lovely_loveseat_price = 254.00

"""
Lets extend our inventory with another characteristic 
piece of furniture! Create a variable called 
stylish_settee_description and assign to it the following 
string:

"""

stylish_settee_description = "Stylish Settee. Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black."
