Imagine waking up in the morning.

You wake up and think, “Ugh. Is it a weekday?”

If so, you have to get up and get dressed and get ready for 
work or school. If not, you can sleep in a bit longer and 
catch a couple extra Zs. But alas, it is a weekday, so you 
are up and dressed and you go to look outside, “Whats the 
weather like? Do I need an umbrella?”

These questions and decisions control the flow of your morning, 
each step and result is a product of the conditions of the 
day and your surroundings. Your computer, just like you, 
goes through a similar flow every time it executes code. A 
program will run (wake up) and start moving through its 
checklists, is this condition met, is that condition met, 
okay lets execute this code and return that value.

This is the control flow of your program. In Python, your 
script will execute from the top down, until there is nothing 
left to run. It is your job to include gateways, known as 
conditional statements, to tell the computer when it should 
execute certain blocks of code. If these conditions are met, 
then run this function.

"""
To build control flow in our program, we need to be able to 
check whether a condition is true or not. For this, we use 
Boolean expressions.

A Boolean expression is a statement that can either be true 
or false. The statement must be answered by true or false 
only, and it must be verifiable with evidence. It cannot 
rely on interpretation or opinion.

To understand this, lets go back to the waking up example. 
The first question, “Is today a weekday?” can be written as 
a Boolean expression shown below:

Today is a weekday.

This expression can be true - if today is Tuesday, for 
example - or false if its a weekend. There are no other 
options, we know the answer is verifiable, and it does not 
rely on an opinion.

Now, consider the following phrase:

Friday is the best day of the week.

"""
Is this a Boolean expression?

No, this statement is an opinion and is subjective. Someone might say that “Wednesday is the best day.” and their statement would be no less true or false than the one above.
