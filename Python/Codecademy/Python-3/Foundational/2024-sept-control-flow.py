Imagine waking up in the morning.

You wake up and think, “Ugh. Is it a weekday?”

If so, you have to get up and get dressed and get ready for work or school. If not, you can sleep in a bit longer and catch a couple extra Z’s. But alas, it is a weekday, so you are up and dressed and you go to look outside, “Whats the weather like? Do I need an umbrella?”
