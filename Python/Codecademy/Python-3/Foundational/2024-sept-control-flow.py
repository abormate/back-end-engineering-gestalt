Imagine waking up in the morning.

You wake up and think, “Ugh. Is it a weekday?”

If so, you have to get up and get dressed and get ready for 
work or school. If not, you can sleep in a bit longer and 
catch a couple extra Zs. But alas, it is a weekday, so you 
are up and dressed and you go to look outside, “Whats the 
weather like? Do I need an umbrella?”

These questions and decisions control the flow of your morning, each step and result is a product of the conditions of the day and your surroundings. Your computer, just like you, goes through a similar flow every time it executes code. A program will run (wake up) and start moving through its checklists, is this condition met, is that condition met, okay lets execute this code and return that value.
