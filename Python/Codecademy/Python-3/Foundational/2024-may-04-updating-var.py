"""
Variables that are assigned numeric values can be treated the same as the 
numbers themselves. Two variables can be added together, divided by 2, and 
multiplied by a third variable without Python distinguishing between the 
variables and literals (like the number 2 in this example). Performing 
arithmetic on variables does not change the variable â€” you can only update 
a variable using the = sign.
