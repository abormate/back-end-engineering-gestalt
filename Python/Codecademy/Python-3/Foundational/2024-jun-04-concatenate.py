"""
The + operator doesn’t just add two numbers, it can also “add” two 
strings! The process of combining two strings is called string 
concatenation. Performing string concatenation creates a brand 
new string comprised of the first string’s contents followed by 
the second string’s contents (without any added space in-between).
