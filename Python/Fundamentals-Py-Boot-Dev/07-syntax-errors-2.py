# Python Syntax Errors -- Backend StudySpace --

"""
Syntax in programming are the rules that define what properly structured expressions and statements look like in that language. For example, in Python, 
the following would be considered correct syntax:

"""

print("hello world")


"""
While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

"""

# fmt.Println("hello world")


"""
Code can have many different problems that prevent it from working as intended. Some examples include:

--> A bug in the logic. For example, a program that should add numbers multiplies them instead
--> A problem with speed. A program that calculates how to play the perfect game of chess might never be able to finish because it requires too many calculations.

--> A problem with syntax. This is the most common problem for new developers. Luckily the Python interpreter will try to give you a descriptive error message 
in the console to help you find the problem.
