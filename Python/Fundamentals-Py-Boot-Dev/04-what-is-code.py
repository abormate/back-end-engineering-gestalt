"""
Code is just a series of instructions that computers can follow. Computers obey each instruction, one after another.

Programs can be comprised of many instructions. Like many. Like millions.

Addition is one of the most common instructions in coding.

print() can print text using quotes:

print("some text here")
but it can also print numbers without quotes:

print(1)
and you can do math directly inside the parentheses:

print(1 + 2)

It's common in videogames to do basic addition. For example, we may need to calculate the additional damage a sword deals when it is enchanted with a spell.

Our hero's sword does 250 normally but does an additional 75 damage when it's enchanted.

Calculate and print the result of 250 + 75.

print(250 + 75)
