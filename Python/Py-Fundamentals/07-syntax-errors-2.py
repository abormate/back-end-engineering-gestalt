"""
Syntax in programming are the rules that define what properly structured expressions and statements look like in that language. For example, in Python, 
the following would be considered correct syntax:

"""

print("hello world")


"""
While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

"""

fmt.Println("hello world")
