"""
A local college is having trouble with its student administration program. They 
have asked you to help them get a student's grade from their English_1010 class.

Here's the structure of a student dictionary:

"""

{
    "type": {
        "student": {
            "name": "Allan",
            "courses": {
                "math_1050": {
                    "current_grade": "B",
                },
                "English_1010": {
                    "current_grade": "A-",
                },
            },
        }
    }
}
