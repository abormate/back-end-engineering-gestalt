Your local gym recently bought out another gym, and they're trying to merge their 
customer data. You've been given 2 lists of customer IDs (numbers) and are trying 
to figure out which customers from the first gym are not also members of the 
second gym. Luckily, the IDs from the 2 gyms match up because they used the same 
back-end servers.

Complete the find_missing_ids function. It accepts two lists as input, and 
returns a new list of all the ids present in the first list but not the second.

Keep in mind, there may be duplicate ids in these lists, the gym workers aren't 
exactly concerned about data integrity. Make sure to remove any duplicates.
