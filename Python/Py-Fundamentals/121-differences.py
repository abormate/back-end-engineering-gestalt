"""
Your local gym recently bought out another gym, and they're trying to merge their 
customer data. You've been given 2 lists of customer IDs (numbers) and are trying 
to figure out which customers from the first gym are not also members of the 
second gym. Luckily, the IDs from the 2 gyms match up because they used the same 
back-end servers.
