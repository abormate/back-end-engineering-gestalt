# -- Find the Difference from List --

"""
We keep track of each character's level in a list. When someone's level changes 
we want to know about it so we can congratulate them! Your assignment is to find 
any differences between the old_character_levels and new_character_levels lists 
and to print the index where the values are different.

The existing code in the loop you've been given loops over all of the indexes in 
old_character_levels. Because old_character_levels and new_character_levels are 
the same lengths, you can reuse i to index into both.

Fill in the loop with code that prints the indexes where the items in the lists 
differ. For example, if the lists are:

"""

old_character_levels = [2, 5, 3, 7, 5]
new_character_levels = [2, 5, 19, 7, 8]

# Then your code should print these indexes 

2
