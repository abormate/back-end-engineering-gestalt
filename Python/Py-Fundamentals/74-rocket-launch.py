"""
A team of scientists is getting ready to launch the rockets they have been 
working on. You've been asked to write a program that will countdown to the 
rockets' launch.

"""
In the countdown_to_blastoff function, write a loop that counts down from 
10 to 1. At each iteration, it should print:

NUM...

Where NUM is replaced with the current number in the countdown. However, 
when NUM is 1, it should instead print:

NUM... Blastoff!
