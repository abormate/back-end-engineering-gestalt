"""
Your teacher has been manually grading tests by hand and it has been taking up 
all of her free time. 

She has asked you to write a program that compares an answer key to a student's 
multiple-choice answers and calculates the percentage of questions they got right.

""" 
Finish the get_test_scores function by looping over the answer_sheet and 
student_answers lists. Calculate and return the student's score.

For example, if these were the lists:

"""

answer_sheet = ["A", "A", "C", "D"]
student_answers = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]

"""
Then the percentage would be 75.00. The percentage should be a float, 
not an integer.
