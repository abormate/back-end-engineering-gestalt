"""
Most of the math operators we went over earlier don't work with strings, aside from the + addition operator. When working with strings the + operator 
performs a "concatenation".

"Concatenation" is a fancy word that means the joining of two strings.

"""

first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Lane"
full_name = first_name + last_name

""""
full_name now holds the value "Lane Lane".

Notice the extra space at the end of "Lane " in the first_name variable. That extra space is there to separate the words in the final result: "Lane Wagner".
