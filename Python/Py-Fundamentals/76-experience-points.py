"""
You've been hired by a game studio to work on their latest role-playing game, in 
this game adventurers need experience points (XP) to level up and become 
stronger. 

You've been tasked with creating a function to calculate the total amount of XP 
needed for a player to reach a specific level.

Each character starts with 0 XP at level 1. To reach the next level, they need 5 
more XP than the last level required. So level 2 requires just 5 XP, while level 
3 requires 10.
