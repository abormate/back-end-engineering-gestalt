"""
In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

"""

# Addition
2 + 1
# 3

# Subtraction
2 - 1
# 1
