"""
In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

"""

# Addition
2 + 1
# 3

# Subtraction
2 - 1
# 1

# Multiplication
2 * 2
# 4

# Division
3 / 2
# 1.5 (a float)

"""
This one is actually a bit different - division on two integers will actually 
produce a float. A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows 
for decimal values.
