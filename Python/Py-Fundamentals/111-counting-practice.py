We need to be able to report to our players how many friends are in their 
immediate vicinity - but they want the count of each enemy by its kind. 

Complete the count_friends function. It takes a list of friends names as input. 

It should return a dictionary where the keys are all the friends names from the list, 
and the values are the counts of how many times each friend appeared in the list.
