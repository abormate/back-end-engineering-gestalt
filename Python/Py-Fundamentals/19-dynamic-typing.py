# -- Dynamic Typing --

"""
Python is dynamically typed. All this means is that a variable can store any type, and that type can change.

For example, if I make a number variable, I can later change that variable to a string:

This is valid:

"""

speed = 5
speed = "five"

# --------------------------- #
# -- Just because you can -- doesn't mean you should --
# --------------------------- #

"""
In almost all circumstances, it's a bad idea to change the type of a variable. The "proper" thing to do is to just create a new one. For example:

"""

speed = 5
speed_description = "five"

# -- What if it weren't dynamically typed?
