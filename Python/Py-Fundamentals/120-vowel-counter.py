"""
Context necessary --

You've been hired by a blogging company and they are asking you to analyze one 
of their recent posts to determine the number of vowels present in their 
paragraphs.


CHALLENGE Activity
Complete the count_vowels function. It should take a string and return a count 
of the number of vowels within the given string, and a set of its unique vowels.

TIP
For this challenge, we are only interested in the 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and 
their capitalized versions. In addition, treat uppercase and lowercase vowels as 
separate. For example, "A" and "a" are not the same.
