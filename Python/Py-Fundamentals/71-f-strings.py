"""
You can create a string with dynamic values by using f-strings in Python. It's a 
beautiful syntax that I wish more programming languages used.

"""

num_bananas = 10
print(f"You have {num_bananas} bananas")
# You have 10 bananas

"""
The opening quotes need to be preceded by an f, then any variables within curly 
brackets have their values "interpolated" (injected) into the string.

"""
At the hometown tavern in Fantasy Quest, the innkeeper offers free meals and 
retirement plans based on the age of his patrons. 

I wrote a function called 
check_for_meals_and_retirement that contains a loop that increments the age 
from a given starting_age to an ending_age exclusive. So we can leave the for 
loop's range as is.

"""

# In the body of the for loop, if age is less than 8 your code should print:

"""
You qualify for free meals. You are AGE years old.

"""

# Otherwise, if age is greater than 65 you should print:

"""
You qualify for retirement. You are AGE years old.

"""

# Where AGE is the current value of the age variable.

# If neither of those conditions is true, don't do anything for that iteration of the loop.
