"""
You can create a string with dynamic values by using f-strings in Python. It's a 
beautiful syntax that I wish more programming languages used.

"""

num_bananas = 10
print(f"You have {num_bananas} bananas")
# You have 10 bananas

"""
The opening quotes need to be preceded by an f, then any variables within curly 
brackets have their values "interpolated" (injected) into the string.
