"""
Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).

For example, the following will print 20:

"""

acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)

"""
The line acceleration = 20 reassigns the value of acceleration to 20. It overwrites whatever was being held in the acceleration variable before.
