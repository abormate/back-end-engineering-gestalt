"""
Bitwise operators are similar to logical operators, but instead of operating on 
boolean values, they apply the same logic to all the bits in a value. For example, 
say you had the numbers 5 and 7 represented in binary. You could perform a 
bitwise AND operation and the result would be 5.


0101 = 5
&
0111 = 7
=
0101 = 5
