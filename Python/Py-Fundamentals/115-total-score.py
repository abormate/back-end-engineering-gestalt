"""
A website that tracks basketball scores and stats is having trouble with its data. 
The first-half score and second-half score are stored in separate dictionaries, 
making it difficult for them to parse the overall score. 

They have asked you to 
help them write a program that merges the two dictionaries and another function 
that calculates the total score.

"""
Complete the merge and total_score functions.

The merge function accepts two score dictionaries as input and returns a single 
merged dictionary that contains all of the keys and values from the input 
dictionaries.

The total_score function should take a single score dictionary as input and 
return the total score calculated from the values of that dictionary. Take a 
look at the test suite near the top of the file for the names of keys to expect. 

If no points were scored, the function should return 0.
