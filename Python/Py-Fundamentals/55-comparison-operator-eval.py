"""
When a comparison happens, the result of the comparison is just a boolean value, 
it's either True or False.

Take the following two examples:

"""

is_bigger = 5 > 4

is_bigger = True

"""
In both of the above cases, we're creating a Boolean variable called is_bigger 
with a value of True.

Because 5 is greater than 4, is_bigger is assigned the value of True.
