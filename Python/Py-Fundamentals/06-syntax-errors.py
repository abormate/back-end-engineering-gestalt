'''
Syntax is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand". For example, the following code is invalid syntax:

'''

prnt("hello world")  #renders a syntax error - misspelling


"""
prnt() is not a valid function because "print" is spelled incorrectly. As a result, an error will be thrown and the code won't execute.

Find the syntax error in the code and correct it.
