"""
As we covered earlier, a float is a positive or negative number with a fractional 
part.

You can add the letter e or E followed by a positive or negative integer to 
specify that you're using scientific notation.

"""

print(16e3)
# Prints 16000.0

print(7.1e-2)
# Prints 0.071

"""
If you're not familiar with scientific notation, it's a way of expressing numbers 
that are too large or too small to conveniently write normally.

In a nutshell, the number following the e specifies how many places to move the 
decimal to the right for a positive number, or to the left for a negative number.

"""
Python also allows you to represent large numbers in the decimal format using 
underscores instead of commas to make it easier to read.

num = 16_000
print(num)
# Prints 16000

num = 16_000_000
print(num)
# Prints 16000000
