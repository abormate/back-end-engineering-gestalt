"""
You are about to write a bit more code in a single function than you have before.

Do not try to write it all at once. Start with the outermost loop, and work your 
way inwards. Add extra print() statements and run your code often to make sure 
it's doing what you expect. Just make sure to remove the extra print() 
statements before submitting your code.
