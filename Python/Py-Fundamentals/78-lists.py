"""
A natural way to organize and store data is in a List. Some languages call them 
"arrays", but in Python we just call them lists. Think of all the apps you use 
and how many of the items in the app are organized into lists.

For example:

A twitter feed is a list of posts
An online store is a list of products
The state of a chess game is a list of moves
This list is a list of things that are lists

"""

# Lists in Python are declared using square brackets, with commas separating each item:

inventory = ["Iron Breastplate", "Healing Potion", "Leather Scraps"]
