"""
Complete the has_enough_gas function.

Do some Pythonic math to determine how many gallons are needed for Tyler to get to 
work AND make it back home after he gets off work. Assign the result to a 
gallons_needed variable.

Return True if there are at least enough gallons in the tank based on the 
gallons_needed variable, and False otherwise.
