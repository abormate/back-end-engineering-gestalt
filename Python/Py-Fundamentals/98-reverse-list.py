"""
Some of our players would like to view their inventories in reverse order.

Let's write a function that takes a list as an input and returns a new list 
except all the items are in reverse order.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 1]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] -> ['d', 'c', 'b', 'a']

"""
The Python range function is very useful when working with lists. Alternately, 
you may want to use list slicing.

-- Where should you start your loop from?

-- Where should you end your loop?

-- What should the step be? In other words, how should you increment i in each 
iteration of the loop?
