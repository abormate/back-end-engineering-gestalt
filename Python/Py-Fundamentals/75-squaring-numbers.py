"""
John is finishing some math homework and needs to calculate the square of some 
numbers. However, he's getting tired of entering each of them into a calculator 
individually.

The square of a number is just the number multiplied by itself.

"""
In the calculate_squares function, write a loop that calculates and prints the 
squares of the numbers from the start parameter up to the given end parameter.

Use the following format to print each line:

"""

# NUM squared = SQUARE

"""
Where NUM is the number, and SQUARE is its square.

For example, the first iteration of the loop in calculate_squares(100, 110) 
should print:

"""

# 100 squared = 10000
