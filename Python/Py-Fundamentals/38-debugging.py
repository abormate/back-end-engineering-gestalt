"""
When you're working as a professional developer, you'll typically write code on your computer and test 
it by yourself before it's deployed to users.

That first part of the process is called debugging. You write some code, run it, and if it doesn't work,
 you fix the bugs. You repeat this process until you're confident that your code works as expected.
