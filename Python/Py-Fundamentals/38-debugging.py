"""
When you're working as a professional developer, you'll typically write code on your computer and test 
it by yourself before it's deployed to users.

That first part of the process is called debugging. You write some code, run it, and if it doesn't work,
 you fix the bugs. You repeat this process until you're confident that your code works as expected.

"""
At Boot.dev, the Run button is for debugging. The Submit button is like shipping your code to production.

You should be debugging your code using the Run button. You should be adding print() statements to your 
code to make sure it's doing what you think it's doing at different points in the code.
