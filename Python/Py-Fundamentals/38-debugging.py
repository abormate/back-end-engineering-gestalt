"""
When you're working as a professional developer, you'll typically write code on your computer and test 
it by yourself before it's deployed to users.

That first part of the process is called debugging. You write some code, run it, and if it doesn't work,
 you fix the bugs. You repeat this process until you're confident that your code works as expected.

# -- Run vs Debug (Submit)
# ------------------------------- #

"""
At Boot.dev, the Run button is for debugging. The Submit button is like shipping your code to production.

You should be debugging your code using the Run button. You should be adding print() statements to your 
code to make sure it's doing what you think it's doing at different points in the code.

-- Write a line to calculate a value
-- print() the value you calculated
-- Run the code
-- Did it print what you expected? If not, fix it
-- Repeat

You will never lose XP or be penalized on Boot.dev for using the run button. However, there are 
consequences for submitting broken code, just like there are career consequences for pushing broken 
code to your users!
