"""
Remember that we can iterate (count) over all the elements in a list using a loop. 
For example, the following code will print each item in the sports list.

"""

# for i in range(0, len(sports)):
#    print(sports[i])

"""
Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within 
their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function. Within the loop, count how many times 
Potion, Bread, and Shortsword appear by incrementing the potion_count, 
bread_count and shortsword_count variables respectively.
