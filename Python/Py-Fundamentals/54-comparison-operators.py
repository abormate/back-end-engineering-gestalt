When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. Boolean logic is the 
name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in True or False.

< "less than"
> "greater than"
<= "less than or equal to"
>= "greater than or equal to"
== "equal to"
!= "not equal to"

5 < 7 # evaluates to True
5 > 7 # evaluates to False
5 >= 7 # evaluates to False
5 <= 7 # evaluates to True
5 == 7 # evaluates to False
5 != 7 # evaluates to True
