# As a reminder, a "for loop" in Python is written like this:

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)

"""
In English, the code says:

1. Start with i equals 0. (i in range(0)
2. If i is greater than or equal to 10 (range(0, 10)), exit the loop.
3. Print i to the console. (print(i))
4. Add 1 to i. (range defaults to incrementing by 1)
5. Go back to step 2


The result is that the numbers 0-9 are logged to the console in order.

In the print_numbers_from_five_to function, edit the for-loop to print every 
number from 5 up to but not including the given end number.
