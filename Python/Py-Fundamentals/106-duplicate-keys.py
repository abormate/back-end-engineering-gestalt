"""
Because dictionaries rely on unique keys, you can't have two of the same key in 
the same dictionary. If you try to use the same key twice, the first value will 
simply be overwritten.

Another developer on our team has introduced a bug by specifying duplicate keys 
in the dictionary! Fix the bug.

The get_character_record function takes a character's name, server, level, and 
rank. It should return a dictionary with the following fields:

name
server
level
rank
id


Where the id is the name and the server concatenated together with a # in the 
middle for uniqueness. We can't have two bloodwarrior123's on the same server!
