Challenge Exercise

You've been working with a biologist who is researching the mating behaviors of 
fruit bats. They've added some calls to the main function that contain invalid 
syntax.

Fix the biologist's syntax error. Use the proper delimiter so that the numbers 
are still easy to parse visually.


The numbers should be:

8 million and 3 million
10 million and 4.5 million
