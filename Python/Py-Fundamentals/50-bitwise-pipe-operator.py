# -- Bitwise "|" (pipe) Operator --

# ------------------------------------- #

"""
As you may have guessed, the bitwise "or" operator is similar to the bitwise "and" 
operator in that it works on binary rather than boolean values. However, the 
bitwise "or" operator "ORs" the bits together. Here's an example:

0101 is 5
0111 is 7
