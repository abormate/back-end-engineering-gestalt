# -- Bitwise "|" (pipe) Operator --
#
# ------------------------------------- #

"""
As you may have guessed, the bitwise "or" operator is similar to the bitwise "and" 
operator in that it works on binary rather than boolean values. However, the 
bitwise "or" operator "ORs" the bits together. Here's an example:

0101 is 5
0111 is 7

Example operations

0101
|     
0111
=
0111

"""

"""
A 1 in binary is the same as True, while 0 is False. So a bitwise operation is 
just a bunch of logical operations that are completed in tandem. When two binary 
numbers are "OR'ed" together, the result has a 1 in any place where either of 
the input numbers has a 1 in that place.
