# It's fairly common to want to change the value of a variable based on its current value.

player_score = player_score + 1
# player_score now equals 5

player_score = 4
player_score = player_score - 1

Don't let the fact that the expression player_score = player_score - 1 is not a 
valid mathematical expression be confusing. It doesn't matter, it is valid code. 

It's valid because the way the expression should be read in English is:

"""

# Assign to player_score the old value of player_score minus 1

Complete the update_player_score function. It should add increment to 
current_score and then return the new current_score.
