"""
Functions allow us to reuse and organize code. For example, let's pretend we need to calculate the area of a circle. We can use the formula area = pi * r^2, or in code:

"""

r = 5
area = 3.14 * r * r

"""
This works great! The problem arises when multiple places in our code need to get the area of a circle.
