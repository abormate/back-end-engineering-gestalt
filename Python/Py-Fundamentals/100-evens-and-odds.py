"""
Write the get_odds_and_evens function to loop through the numbers list and check 
if each number in the list is either odd or even.

Increment the num_evens counter if even, and the num_odds counter if it's odd. 
Lastly, return the two values num_odds and num_evens in that order.

----------
!! TIP !!
----------

Remember, you can check if a number is even by using the modulo operator (%).
