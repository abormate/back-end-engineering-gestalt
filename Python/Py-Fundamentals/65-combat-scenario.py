"""
A new text-based RPG you are building doesn't have any way for players to know if 
they are strong enough to fight certain enemies.

If a player's power level is greater than the enemies' defense that player has an 
advantage

If the player's power and enemies' defense are equal they are evenly matched
Otherwise, that player has a disadvantage.
