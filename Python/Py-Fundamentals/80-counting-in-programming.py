In the world of programming, counting is a bit strange!

We don't start counting at 1, we start at 0 instead.

"""
Each item in a list has an index that refers to its spot in the list.

Take the following list as an example:

"""

names = ["Bob", "Lane", "Alice", "Breanna"]

"""
Index 0: Bob
Index 1: Lane
Index 2: Alice
Index 3: Breanna
