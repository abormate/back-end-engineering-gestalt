Remember that the increment and decrement operators can increment or decrement a 
variable by any amount.

"""
Fix the bug in the sum_of_numbers function. Instead of adding 1 to total at 
each iteration of the loop, it should add i. For example, instead of:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...

we want:

0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...

The desired output is a single number after the loop has finished executing.
