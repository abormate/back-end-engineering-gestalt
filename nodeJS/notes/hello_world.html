Creating our JavaScript program
Below are the steps you need to follow to create a “Hello, World!” JavaScript program.

1. Make a New Folder for this Program
Navigate to your projects folder using your file manager or the terminal. Then inside the folder, create a new folder called helloJavaScript. This folder will store the file(s) that you’ll need.

2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Open Your New Project’s Folder
Click on the ‘Explorer’ icon on the left-hand menu and click on the button ‘Open Folder’ and choose your development folder. This will launch your file manager.

Navigate to the helloJavaScript folder and select Open. The folder will open in Visual Studio Code’s side pane. At this point, there should not be any contents in the folder. We’ll add a file in the next step.

4. Add a File.
In Visual Studio Code’s Explorer pane, click on your development folder’s name. You’ll see four icons appear to the right of the folder name. Click the ‘New File’ icon. Type in the name of what you want to name your file with the correct file extension. It’s good practice to name the file something that matches the purpose of that file. In this case, you should name the file something like, hello.js. Press Enter when done.

5. Begin coding!
Copy and paste the following boilerplate JavaScript code (or add your own JavaScript code):

console.log('Hello, World!');
Save your file often with the Auto Save feature and track changes with a version control system if you know how to use one. (To turn Auto Save on, click on ‘File’ then ‘Auto Save’. When it’s on, you’ll see a checkmark next to ‘Auto Save’.) This will decrease the chances of losing unsaved work.

If your file has the right extension .js and your code has no syntax errors, you should see the correct syntax highlighting in VSCode!

Here’s what your file in VSCode should look like:

6. Use Node to Run Your Program
At this point, your program can be executed by Node!

You can use your terminal or VSCode’s built-in terminal to run the command:

node hello.js
Here’s how it could look if you’re using your terminal:

How’s how it could look like if you’re using VSCode’s built-in terminal:

If you’re not seeing the correct results, make sure that you’re in the correct folder in your terminal and that you’ve typed in the correct name of your file.

Wrapping up
Congratulations, you’ve successfully used VSCode to log out "Hello, World!" the quintessential program for getting started! As you develop more, you’ll be able to create more robust programs and apps — straight from your own computer!
