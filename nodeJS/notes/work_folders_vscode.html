<p>If you haven’t already set up a dedicated folder for your coding projects, now is a good time to start. It’s important to establish an organized file system especially as the number and size of your projects grow. The program we’re creating for this article will be small, but again, it’s a good habit to build.

One convention is naming this directory projects. It will store all of your coding projects. Whenever you create a new project, no matter how small, you should always make a new folder inside your projects directory. You will find that single-file projects can quickly turn into large, multi-folder projects.
