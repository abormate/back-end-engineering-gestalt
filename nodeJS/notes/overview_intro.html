       Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment which runs JavaScript code outside of the browser. A “runtime” converts code written in a high-level, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute. Node was created with the goal of building web servers and web applications in JavaScript, but it’s a powerful and flexible environment that can be used for building all sorts of applications.
